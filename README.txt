Tetris clone using PyGame: www.pygame.org . I used: www.ninja-ide.org, 
as my IDE.

The graphics button from Angry birds, they own them, I used it for 
educational purpose. If requested to be removed, will do immediately. 

Other graphic assets from the tetris tutorial made by a kind guy from 
brazil using Slick2D, which is now defunct and the website is down, pity
that I can't give proper credits to him.

Requires Python 3.2 and PyGame 1.9.2 (now in Zombie mode), to run the
tetrisclone.py.
