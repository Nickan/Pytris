Tetris clone using PyGame: www.pygame.org . I used: www.ninja-ide.org , as my IDE.
Python version: 3.2
PyGame version: 1.9.2
Ninja IDE version: 2.1

The graphics button is from Angry birds, they own them, I used it for educational purpose. If requested to be removed,
will do immediately. Other graphic assets from the tetris tutorial made by a kind guy from brazil using Slick2D, 
that is now defunct, that's why I can't specifically credit him for the assets, and the rest from various sources which
later I will put all of them here.
